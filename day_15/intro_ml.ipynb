It included a racial feature (\"B\") that linked race to housing prices, which is discriminatory. The dataset is also outdated and too small (506 samples) for modern ML applications. Using such biased data can lead to unfair predictions. Alternatives include the California Housing Dataset and Ames Housing Dataset for regression tasks.\n",

    "###### Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library in Python. It provides tools for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and data preprocessing. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib and is easy to use for both beginners and experts. It is used for building machine learning models, data analysis, and AI applications. It is widely used in research, industry, and academia for predictive modeling. ðŸš€\n",
