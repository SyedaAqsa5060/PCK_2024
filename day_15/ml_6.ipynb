    "Data Preprocessing is the process of preparing raw data before feeding it into a machine learning algorithm. It helps improve the accuracy, efficiency, and performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”§ Why is Data Preprocessing Important?\n",
    "Raw data usually contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "Inconsistent formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise or errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Different scales of features\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrelevant data\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use such data directly in models, the results will be inaccurate or misleading. So, preprocessing ensures the data is clean, well-structured, and ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”„ Steps in Data Preprocessing:\n",
    "Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle missing values (e.g., fill, drop)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix inconsistent entries (like spelling mistakes)\n",

    "Data Transformation\n",

    "Scaling features (Standardization or Normalization)\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding)\n",
    "\n",
    "Log transformation for skewed data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine data from multiple sources\n",

    "Data Reduction\n",

    "Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating new features from existing ones\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ§  Example:\n",
    "You have a dataset like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Name\tAge\tSalary\tGender\n",
    "Ali\t25\t50000\tMale\n",
    "Ayesha\t\t62000\tFemale\n",
    "Sara\t30\t?\tFemale\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps in preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill missing age (maybe with average)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill or drop missing salary\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert \"Gender\" to numbers (e.g., Male = 0, Female = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Scale \"Age\" and \"Salary\" using standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ In simple words:\n",
    "Data preprocessing means cleaning and preparing your data so that it becomes suitable for machines to learn from. It is like sharpening your tools before doing the main task.\n",
