    "Supervised ML algorithm (Classification + Regression).\n",
    "Predicts label/value of a new point by looking at its K nearest neighbors.\n",
    "Lazy learner → no training phase, only prediction time work.\n",

    "- 🔹 When to Use?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset output (Y) categorical → Classification\n",
    "- Dataset output (Y) continuous/numerical → Regression\n",
    "## 🔹 Advantages\": \n",
    "- ✅ Simple & intuitive\n",
    "- ✅ No training cost (fast to set up)\n",
    "- ✅ Works with non-linear decision boundaries\n",
    "- ✅ Handles multi-class problems\n",
    "## 🔹 Disadvantages\n",
    "- ❌ Prediction slow (distance calc for every test point)\n",
    "- ❌ Memory hungry (stores all training data)\n",
    "- ❌ Sensitive to irrelevant features & scaling\n",
    "- ❌ High dimensions → distance becomes meaningless (curse of dimensionality)\n",
    "# 🔹 Important Points\n",
    "- always normalize/standardize features before KNN.\n",
    "- Best K chosen using cross-validation.\n",
    "- Small K → noisy results, large K → smoother but may ignore local patterns.\n",
    "### 🔹 Shortcut Memory Trick\" :\n",
    "1. 👉 KNN = “Look at your K closest neighbors, follow majority (classification) or average (regression).”\n",
    "2. ⚡ Bas ye points yaad rakh lo → exam me koi bhi question (definition, working, pros/cons, example) easily tackle kar logi.\n",
    "3. Chaho main tumhe ek 1-page mindmap/diagram bana ke dikhau (distance + voting + pros/cons ek jagah pe)?"
